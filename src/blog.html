        <h3>3 reasons why Australian Businesses should have a .com.au domain name</h3>

        <p>To put it simply, your domain name is your business’ online identity. Just like a physical store, you’ll want your online <em>address</em> to be memorable and easy to find on the net.</p>
        <p> One question that often arises is whether an Australian business should register a .com.au or .com domain. Below we will outline the advantages of having a .com.au for your Australian business.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Your Australian customers trust .com.au domain names</strong></p>
        <p> Australian customers recognise and trust the .com.au domain name extension. They’re used to seeing it in advertising and when dealing with Australian businesses. This is especially important for local e-commerce businesses who ship goods in Australia. The .com.au extension on your domain name is not unlike the other trust signals your web designer would use to help build trust with your customer for e.g. a secure website using an SSL certificate.</p>
        <p><strong>2. The eligibility criteria proves that your business is Australian</strong></p>
        <p>The major benefit of .com.au domain names is that they instantly tell someone you are an Australian based business and are here to serve Australian customers. There’s a set of criteria that must be met before someone can register a .com.au domain name.</p>
        <p><strong>3. A .com.au domain name may help with your Google Ranking</strong></p>
        <p>Having a .com.au domain name helps Google understand where your business is based or operates. If you used a .com, Google would have a harder time ranking you for local searches — it would be dependent on other elements of your website to know which market you service.</p>

        <p>Drawing from the information gathered in Steps 1 and 2, it’s time now to determine how your site looks and feels.</p>
        <p>It is important to keep in mind that most people will view your website on a mobile device. Make sure that your mobile site is user-friendly and clear.</p>
        <p>As part of the design phase, it is also important to incorporate elements such as the company logo or colours to help strengthen the identity of your company or brand on the website.</p>
        <p>If you have chosen WordPress as your Content Management System (CMS), there are thousands of templates out there (free and paid) which may suit your purposes. Don’t think that you have to build your website from scratch, and don’t be
          hesitant to spend $60 on a good WordPress theme. It will be worth it in the end.</p>
        <p>If you choose to go with a web designer, they will create one or more prototype designs. As a website designer I will usually give you secure access to your website to view work in progress. Communication between both you and your designer
          is crucial to ensure that the final product will match your needs most importantly and taste. It is important that you work closely with your designer, exchanging ideas, until you arrive at the final design for your website.</p>

        <h3>The website design process: Step 2 – Planning</h3>

        <p>
        The second step in designing your website is the planning step.</p>
        <p>Take your time on this one because it will save you a lot of time and hassle in the future.</p>
        <p>This step involves creating a sitemap i.e. a list of all main topic areas of the website, as well as sub-topics etc. Be as detailed and clear as possible.</p>
        <p>The user of your website must be kept in mind when designing your site.</p>
        <p>And remember: A good user interface (UI) will (hopefully) create a memorable user experience (UX).</p>
        <strong>CMS:</strong>
        <p>You might want to do some research regarding what CMS (Content Management System) to use i.e. WordPress.org, WordPress.com, Joomla, Shopify etc.</p>
        <p>You might ask me “Which CMS is the best?”</p>
        <p>Well, that depends on what you want to do on your website and your budget.</p>
        <strong>Hosting:</strong>
        <p>Below is a list of Hosting companies you might want to look at. You can also buy domain names from them at relatively cheap prices:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>SiteGround</li>
          <li>Bluehost</li>
          <li>Netregistry</li>
          <li>HostGator</li>
          <li>GoDaddy</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Functionality:</strong>
        <p>Another aspect to think about is what functionality is needed for your website. Will you have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact forms?</li>
          <li>Live Chat?</li>
          <li>Sliders?</li>
          <li>Photo Galleries?</li>
          <li>Forums?</li>
          <li>Facebook or Instagram feeds?</li>
          <ul>

        <p>Answer these simple questions before you start your new website:</p>
        <p>What is the purpose or goal of my website?</p>
        <p>Do I want to provide information? Promote my services? Sell my product?</p>
        <p>What do I want to accomplish at the end of the day by building this website?</p>
        <p>To make money? Share information? Share my passion for something? Create a platform for communication?</p>
        <p>Do similar websites exist already?</p>
        <p>Where can I add value for my potential customers or differentiate my website from those that already exist?</p>
        <p>Is there a specific target audience that will help me reach my goals?</p>
        <p>What kind of information will my target audience be looking for on my site? Will I also be implementing a social media strategy?</p>
        <p>These are just some of the questions you should be asking yourself.</p>
