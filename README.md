## Target Audience

My target audience is for people currently looking for freelancers to build their website and create a digital marketing strategy. As I grow my portfolio I would like to 
also expand into more development roles which is why I call myself a 'Junior Developer'. Ultimately this will result in working for a more established technology company.
